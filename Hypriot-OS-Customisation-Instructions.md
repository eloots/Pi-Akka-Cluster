## Pi-Hypriot OS customisation instructions

> With support for `cloud-init` being present in the [Hypriot OS](http://blog.hypriot.com) distribution, we switch to using this tool instead starting from a standard installation and then going through a lengthy manual install

The installation is now relatively simple:

Download and install the Hypriot _**flash**_ tool by following the instructions in the **Quick start** section [on this page](https://blog.hypriot.com/post/releasing-HypriotOS-1-8/).

Using the `akka-pi-os.yml` file in this repo, a 16GB micro SD card and an appropriate flash card reader/writer, you are now set to flash an SD card. You will probably customise at least one parameter in the `.yml`: the IP-address of the node (current value is _192.168.0.102_).

The command to flash the card is:

```
flash -n node-1 -u static.yml https://github.com/hypriot/image-builder-rpi/releases/download/v1.9.0/hypriotos-rpi-v1.9.0.img.zip
```

`-n node-1` specifies the host name for the host. Set it to a name of the host this card is destined for (`node-0` through `node-4`)

We're also using the latest version of Hypriot at the time of writing. For a complete list if available versions, see the [downloads page](https://blog.hypriot.com/downloads/).

Insert the card into the micro SD slot on your Raspberry Pi (should work on Raspberry Pi 2 and 3 - Model B and B+), power-up the Pi and log-in as user _akkapi_ using ssh (password is also _akkapi_).

Install Java:

```
$ sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer
```

On your Laptop, copy the `librpi_ws281x.so` shared library from the repo to the _akkapi_ home directory on the Pi and copy the `run*` scripts to the Pi:

```
Pi-Akka-Cluster git:(master) ✗ scp -r rpi_ws281x akkapi@node-1:/home/akkapi
Pi-Akka-Cluster git:(master) ✗ CLUSTER_NR=0 ./updatePiScripts
```

You should be all set and ready to run the exercises in the repo!

#### Repeat process for nodes 1 through 4

> Note: the instructions below (installing k8s and tmux) still have to be integrated into the _cloud-init_ based install. Stay tuned for that...

#### Notes on differences between this setup and the one in the book

- I decided to use local IP-addresses in a reserved range on my local LAN (192.168.0.X with X >= 100)
- I didn't add IP-forwarding on the kubernetes node, so the instructions to edit `/etc/sysctl.conf` and tuning of `/etc/rc.local` weren't executed.

#### Install Kubernetes

Slightly adapted instructions I used:

Add encryption keys for the packages:

```
$ curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
```

```
$ sudo vi /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
$ more /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
deb http://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade
$ sudo apt-get install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl kubernetes-cni
```

Execute the above step on all nodes.

We now switch to the _akkapi_ user to change a couple of things:

```
$ su - akkapi
Password:
HypriotOS/armv7: akkapi@node-0 in ~

$ groups
akkapi video docker pirate

$ cat > .profile.tmux <<EOF
tnr() {
   tmux new -s run
}

tr() {
   tmux attach -t run
}

tnl() {
   tmux new -s log
}

tl() {
   tmux attach -t log
}

tkillall() {
   for session in `tmux ls | sed -e 's/:.*//'`;do
     tmux kill-session -t $session
   done
}
EOF
```

Next, edit the _.profile_ file to add `. .profile.tmux` at the end of the file. The end of that file now looks like:

```
$ tail -4 .profile

mesg n

. .profile.tmux
HypriotOS/armv7: akkapi@node-0 in ~
```

Next, we set-up password-less login. We assume that we want to log in to account _akkapi_ on a pi from an account (_userxxx_) on your laptop named _A_.

First, we need a pair of authentication keys on the laptop. If these keys have been generated already we can skip the generation of a new pair of authentication keys. If this isn't the case, generate them:

```
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/userxxx/.ssh/id_rsa): 
Created directory '/home/userxxx/.ssh'.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /home/userxxx/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/userxxx/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
3e:4f:05:79:3a:9f:96:7c:3b:ad:e9:58:37:bc:37:e4 userxxx@A
``` 

Use an empty passphrase (just hit _Enter_)

As can be seen from the output generated by _ssh-keygen_, a pair of files (`id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub`) are created in the (hidden) folder `.ssh` in the users home folder.

Now, proceed by create a `.ssh` folder on the _akkapi_'s home folder on the Pi and copy the public key (`id_rsa.pub`) to a file named `authorized_keys` in the `.ssh` folder. You will have to supply the password for the _akkapi_ account for the two commands launched.

```
 [userxxx@Eric-Loots-MBP] $ ssh akkapi@node-0 mkdir .ssh
akkapi@node-0's password:

 [userxxx@Eric-Loots-MBP] $ cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh akkapi@node-0 'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys'
akkapi@node-0's password:
```

With this, you should now be able to log into the _akkapi_ on _node-0_ from the _userxxx_ account on laptop _A_ without having to enter a password.

As a final modification, we give account _akkapi_ sudo rights. First, log-in with the _pirate_ account on the pi and add two lines to file `/etc/sudoers.d/90-cloud-init-users`:

```
 [ericloots@Eric-Loots-MBP] $ ssh pirate@node-0
HypriotOS/armv7: pirate@node-0 in ~

$ sudo vi /etc/sudoers.d/90-cloud-init-users
HypriotOS/armv7: pirate@node-0 in ~

$ sudo cat /etc/sudoers.d/90-cloud-init-users
# Created by cloud-init v. 0.7.6 on Thu, 03 Jul 2014 18:46:34 +0000

# User rules for pirate
pirate ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
# User rules for akkapi
akkapi ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
HypriotOS/armv7: pirate@node-0 in ~
```

> Note: as file `/etc/sudoers.d/90-cloud-init-users` has read-only file protections set, you must force-write the file (enter the `w!` instead of `w` in vi).

### Intermediate stage backup

_Probably a good time to make a backup of what we have so far._

## Driving a NeoPixel 8-LED strip

Install build-tools (gcc, ...) & _swig_:

```
sudo apt install build-essential
sudo apt-get install swig
sudo apt-get install scons
```

__Download and build software__ (see instructions in README.md in the repo) for driving NeoPixels: [rpi_ws281x](https://github.com/jgarff/rpi_ws281x)

Install JDK 8:

```
$ sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-jdk
$ sudo apt-get update
```

Set `JAVA_HOME`

```
$ sudo update-alternatives --config java
There is 1 choice for the alternative java (providing /usr/bin/java).

  Selection    Path                                     Priority   Status
------------------------------------------------------------
  0            /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/jre/bin/java   1081      auto mode
* 1            /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/jre/bin/java   1081      manual mode
```

This tells us that `JAVA_HOME` is `/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle`

```
$ export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle
$ git clone git@github.com:jgarff/rpi_ws281x.git
$ cd rpi_ws281x
$ rm -rf *.o
$ scons
$ mkdir java
$ cp python/*.i java
$ cd java
$ swig -package neopixel -java rpi_ws281x.i
$ gcc -c *.c -I${JAVA_HOME}/include -I${JAVA_HOME}/include/linux
$ gcc -shared -o librpi_ws281x.so ../*.o rpi_ws281x_wrap.o
$ ls -l librpi_ws281x.so
-rwxr-xr-x 1 akkapi akkapi 94444 Aug 15 13:18 librpi_ws281x.so
```

Running sample application `exercise_000_initial_state`:

```
$ ./run 0
```

## Running base cluster with status LED indicators

> Note: for convenience, set-up password-less ssh so that you can log-in to the PIs without having to enter a password

On your laptop, run sbt and build an uber-jar if not done already:

```
$ sbt

Log in on the different node (use a multi-session terminal like iTerm-2 on MacOS for efficiency) and run the exercise code using the `run` script (copy this script from the repo to all nodes). The `run` command takes a single argument which is the number of the exercise you want to run.


> Note: The LED strip is powered from the 5V pin on the Raspberry Pi board. However, the GPIO pin that drives the data input pin on the LED strip is a 3.3V logical signal. This causes intermittent flashes on the LED's. This problem can be solved easily by putting a diode (such as an 1N4001) between the 5V pin on the Pi and the power connection on the LED strip.

> Note: Install `tmux` on the cluster nodes (`apt-get install tmux`) and always (interactive sessions) in a `tmux` session. This prevents processes (eg. nodes) getting killed when the connectivity of a node and your computer is broken (for example, as part of some test scenario like a network partition).

## Hardware build instructions

- Instructions on how to assemble the LED status strip can be found [here](LED-status-indicator-assembly-instructions.md)

- Assembling the Pi's to form a physical cluster is relatively straightforward. See diagram [Cluster set-up schema](images/Cluster-set-up-schema.pdf) to see how it all connects together
