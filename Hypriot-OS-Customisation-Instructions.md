## Pi-Hypriot OS customisation instructions

On your Mac, add the following entries to your _/etc/hosts_ file:

```
# Cluster #0
192.168.0.101 node-0
192.168.0.102 node-1
192.168.0.103 node-2
192.168.0.104 node-3
192.168.0.105 node-4
```

> With support for `cloud-init` being present in the [Hypriot OS](http://blog.hypriot.com) distribution, we switch to using this tool instead starting from a standard installation and then going through a lengthy manual install

The installation is now relatively simple:

Download and install the Hypriot _**flash**_ tool by following the instructions in the **Quick start** section [on this page](https://blog.hypriot.com/post/releasing-HypriotOS-1-8/).

Using the `akka-pi-os.yml` file in this repo, a 16GB micro SD card and a flash card reader/writer, you are now set to flash an SD card. You will probably customise at least one parameter in the `.yml`: the IP-address of the node (current value is _192.168.0.101_).

> NOTE: Edit `akka-pi-os.yml` to change line: `static ip_address=192.168.0.102/24` for each node.

The command to flash the card is:

```
Pi-Akka-Cluster git:(master) ✗ flash -n node-0 -u akka-pi-os.yml https://github.com/hypriot/image-builder-rpi/releases/download/v1.9.0/hypriotos-rpi-v1.9.0.img.zip
```

`-n node-0` specifies the host name for the host. For other nodes, set it to a name of the host this card is destined for (`node-0` through `node-4`)

We're also using the latest version of Hypriot (1.9.0 at the time of writing). For a complete list of available versions, see the [downloads page](https://blog.hypriot.com/downloads/).

Insert the card into the micro SD slot on your Raspberry Pi (should work on Raspberry Pi 2 and 3 - Model B and B+), power-up the Pi and log-in as user _akkapi_ using ssh (password is also _akkapi_).

#### Repeat process for nodes 1 through 4

The installation of the OS as described in the previous section should be repeated for the remaining nodes. Make sure to pass the correct hostname (`node-1` ... `node-4`) to the `flash` script and to set the corresponding IP address in the `akka-pi-os.yml` file.

#### Configure password-less login

Next, we set-up password-less login. We assume that we want to log in to account _akkapi_ on a pi from an account (_userxxx_) on your laptop.

First, we need a pair of authentication keys on the laptop. If these keys have been generated already we can skip the generation of a new pair of authentication keys. If this isn't the case, generate them:

```
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/userxxx/.ssh/id_rsa): 
Created directory '/home/userxxx/.ssh'.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /home/userxxx/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/userxxx/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
3e:4f:05:79:3a:9f:96:7c:3b:ad:e9:58:37:bc:37:e4 userxxx@A
``` 

Use an empty passphrase (just hit _Enter_)

As can be seen from the output generated by _ssh-keygen_, a pair of files (`id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub`) are created in the (hidden) folder `.ssh` in the users home folder.

Now, proceed by create a `.ssh` folder on the _akkapi_'s home folder on the Pi and copy the public key (`id_rsa.pub`) to a file named `authorized_keys` in the `.ssh` folder. You will have to supply the password for the _akkapi_ account for the two commands launched.

```
[Pi-Akka-Cluster git:(master) ✗ for node in 0 1 2 3 4;do ssh akkapi@node-${node} mkdir .ssh; done
akkapi@node-0's password:
```

Copy the contents of your *public key* to the `authorized_keys` file:

```
Pi-Akka-Cluster git:(master) ✗ for node in 0 1 2 3 4;do cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh akkapi@node-${node} 'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys'; done
akkapi@node-0's password:
```

With this, you should now be able to log into the _akkapi_ on _node-0_ from the _userxxx_ account on laptop without having to enter a password.

##### Copy the LED driver shared library and install Pi-scripts

On your Laptop, copy the `librpi_ws281x.so` shared library from the repo to the _akkapi_ home directory on the Pi and copy the `run*` scripts to the Pi:

```
Pi-Akka-Cluster git:(master) ✗ for node in 0 1 2 3 4;do scp -r librpi_ws281x.so akkapi@node-${node}:/home/akkapi; done
Pi-Akka-Cluster git:(master) ✗ CLUSTER_NR=0 ./updatePiScripts
```

Login on each node with the _akkapi_ account to change a couple of things (the password for the _akkapi_ user is _akkapi_):

```
Pi-Akka-Cluster git:(master) ✗ for node in 0 1 2 3 4; do cat .profile.tmux | ssh akkapi@node-${node} 'cat >> .profile.tmux'; done
```

Next, we change the _.profile_ file to add `. .profile.tmux` at the end of the file. 

```
Pi-Akka-Cluster git:(master) ✗ for node in 0 1 2 3 4; do echo ". .profile.tmux" | ssh akkapi@node-${node} 'cat >> .profile'; done
```

#### Finish by installing java & kubernetes

The installation can now be finished by running a number of commands on each node. When using iTerm2 on a Mac, this can effectively be done in parallel using the simultaneous input on 5 terminal sessions, one for each node.

##### Install Java

Run the `install-java` command on each node. This will install the latest version of Java 8.

#### [Optional] Install Kubernetes

Run the `install-kubernetes` command on each node.

## Addendum

### Driving a NeoPixel 8-LED strip

This section explains how to build the LED driver shared library on a Pi.

On a Raspberry-Pi, install build-tools (gcc, ...), _swig_ and _scons_:

```
sudo apt install build-essential
sudo apt-get install swig
sudo apt-get install scons
```

__Download and build software__ (see instructions in README.md in the repo) for driving NeoPixels: [rpi_ws281x](https://github.com/jgarff/rpi_ws281x)

Install JDK 8 (if not already installed):

```
$ sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-jdk
$ sudo apt-get update
```

Set `JAVA_HOME`

```
$ sudo update-alternatives --config java
There is 1 choice for the alternative java (providing /usr/bin/java).

  Selection    Path                                     Priority   Status
------------------------------------------------------------
  0            /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/jre/bin/java   1081      auto mode
* 1            /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/jre/bin/java   1081      manual mode
```

This tells us that `JAVA_HOME` is `/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle`

```
$ export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle
$ git clone git@github.com:jgarff/rpi_ws281x.git
$ cd rpi_ws281x
$ rm -rf *.o
$ scons
$ mkdir java
$ cp python/*.i java
$ cd java
$ swig -package neopixel -java rpi_ws281x.i
$ gcc -c *.c -I${JAVA_HOME}/include -I${JAVA_HOME}/include/linux
$ gcc -shared -o librpi_ws281x.so ../*.o rpi_ws281x_wrap.o
$ ls -l librpi_ws281x.so
-rwxr-xr-x 1 akkapi akkapi 94444 Aug 15 13:18 librpi_ws281x.so
```

Running sample application `exercise_000_initial_state`:

```
$ ./run 0
```

## Running base cluster with status LED indicators

> Note: for convenience, set-up password-less ssh so that you can log-in to the PIs without having to enter a password

On your laptop, run sbt and build an uber-jar if not done already:

```
$ sbt

Log in on the different node (use a multi-session terminal like iTerm-2 on MacOS for efficiency) and run the exercise code using the `run` script (copy this script from the repo to all nodes). The `run` command takes a single argument which is the number of the exercise you want to run.


> Note: The LED strip is powered from the 5V pin on the Raspberry Pi board. However, the GPIO pin that drives the data input pin on the LED strip is a 3.3V logical signal. This causes intermittent flashes on the LED's. This problem can be solved easily by putting a diode (such as an 1N4001) between the 5V pin on the Pi and the power connection on the LED strip.

> Note: Install `tmux` on the cluster nodes (`apt-get install tmux`) and always (interactive sessions) in a `tmux` session. This prevents processes (eg. nodes) getting killed when the connectivity of a node and your computer is broken (for example, as part of some test scenario like a network partition).

## Hardware build instructions

- Instructions on how to assemble the LED status strip can be found [here](LED-status-indicator-assembly-instructions.md)

- Assembling the Pi's to form a physical cluster is relatively straightforward. See diagram [Cluster set-up schema](images/Cluster-set-up-schema.pdf) to see how it all connects together
