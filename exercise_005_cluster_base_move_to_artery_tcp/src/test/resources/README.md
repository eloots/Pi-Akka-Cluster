# Switch remoting transport from default to Artery-TCP

`Akka 2.5.11` introduced an new remoting transport named `Artery TCP`.

`Artery TCP` is built on top of `Akka Streams` and provides an alternative
for the existing TCP based transport.

Apart from giving lower latency and higher throughput, `Artery TCP`
also utilises separate TCP connections for user- and system traffic.
This is important as it prevents user traffic from 'pushing out'
system messages which in turn may lead to pushing out `Akka Cluster`
gossip messages.

It is expected that `Artery TCP` will become the default remoting
transport protocol in a future `Akka` release.

In this example, we take the code from the previous exercise and
switch the transport to `Artery TCP`
